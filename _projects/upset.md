UpSet visualises set intersections in a matrix layout. The matrix layout enables the effective representation of associated data, such as the number of elements in the intersections. Upset 2.0 integrates accessibility features to the web editor by automatically generating short and long descriptions of the plots, as well as providing a guided interface for visualisation authors to write or edit custom descriptions for Upset plots.
