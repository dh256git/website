The Flow & Interaction Group is excited to launch our new website. We built it to make our work easier to discover, follow, and share, by students, collaborators, and anyone curious about how blind and sighted people experience flow during interaction with tactile interfaces, screen reader accessible representational systems and productivity tools, as well as play.

What’s new? First, everything is organised by research themes, so you can browse the areas we’re actively developing and see how they connect. Each theme brings together projects, selected publications, and media in one place. Publications now link to related blog posts, podcasts, and videos—so you can jump from a paper to a talk, demo, or transcript with a single click. Our Media section gathers all posts, podcasts, and videos, and the People page highlights our team and research collaborators with simple profiles.

We also focused on clarity and accessibility: fast, lightweight pages; clean typography; high-contrast styling; keyboard-friendly navigation; and transcripts. Behind the scenes, the site is designed for low maintenance and long-term reliability, so we can spend more time doing research—and sharing it—than tending the website.

Have a look around, start with a theme that interests you, or explore our latest news. If you find something useful, please share it with a colleague or student. We’ll keep adding new results, media, and opportunities to collaborate—watch this space.
