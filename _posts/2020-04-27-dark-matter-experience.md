Dark matter makes up a quarter of our universe—yet it is invisible, untouchable, and mysterious. We asked ourselves: what if people could not only learn about dark matter, but *feel* it?

At the London Science Museum, we created a multisensory exhibit that transformed this elusive substance into a tangible journey. Inside an inflatable planetarium, visitors reclined on beanbags and were guided through our galaxy. Along the way, they experienced carefully choreographed sensations: swirling tactile patterns on their skin from mid-air haptics, storm-like sounds of a “dark matter wind,” a sharp scent of black pepper, and even the crackling surprise of popping candy echoing in their heads.

This wasn’t about teaching equations or technical details. Instead, our goal was to evoke curiosity, emotion, and memory—what it feels like to journey through something we cannot see. Visitors described the experience as “fun,” “unexpected,” even “magical.” Many queued for over 45 minutes just to step into the dome.

By blending touch, sound, smell, taste, and sight, we offered a new way to encounter the cosmos—beyond the eye, into the body. We believe this multisensory storytelling can open astronomy to wider audiences, making the invisible universe not just imaginable, but unforgettable.
