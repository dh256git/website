  Closed captions and audio description became the de facto method of creating accessible audio-visual content for people with hearing and visual impairments respectively. However, in some cases it is not possible to adequately convey all relevant information through the existing channels of creative content and its assistive alternative. For example, in educational videos, a continuous narration of a scientific concept, illustrated via animated content may not afford the use of audio description to detail the visual scene. Thus, in this demonstration, we propose to use ultrasonic mid-air haptic technology for including ``closed haptions'' with a three minute long video. Our video illustrates the concept of Single-Stroke and Multi-Stroke Dynamic Tactile Pointers -- a novel method of rendering tactile shapes in mid-air. Recent research has shown that using a Multi-Stroke Dynamic Tactile Pointer instead of Spatiotemporal Modulation, to render geometric forms in mid-air, increases the ability of users to identify shapes by approximately 30%. This is a significant finding with implications in tactile icon design for various user interfaces, and accessibility of teaching geometry for visually impaired students in secluded regions. Besides the closed haptioning of our video, attendees will be tasked with determining the order of five tactile geometric shapes in mid-air, presented in random order, using three different methods of rendering.
