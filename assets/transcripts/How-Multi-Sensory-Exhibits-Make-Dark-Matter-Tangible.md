**Speaker 1:**
Dark matter. You know, it's this cosmic ghost making up something like a quarter of our universe, yet it's completely out of reach for our senses.

**Speaker 2:**
Yeah, we know it's there because we see its gravity pulling things around galaxies, but actually feeling it or seeing it—that's a whole different ball game.

**Speaker 1:**
It's the ultimate invisible force, isn’t it? Trying to get your head around something so fundamental, but so alien to our everyday experience, that’s a massive hurdle for science communication.

**Speaker 2:**
It really is. It makes explaining it really challenging.

**Speaker 1:**
Definitely. So today on the Deep Dive, we’re exploring a fascinating project. One that didn’t just explain dark matter—it tried to make you actually feel it.

**Speaker 2:**
How exactly?

**Speaker 1:**
Well, imagine stepping inside this dark dome, putting on headphones, and suddenly you’re not just learning about dark matter, you’re becoming a detector yourself.

**Speaker 2:**
Wow.

**Speaker 1:**
Feeling these cosmic winds. Tasting the universe in a way.

**Speaker 2:**
Okay, that sounds pretty wild.

**Speaker 1:**
It is. Our mission today is to unpack a paper that details the whole exhibit. It was co-created by physicists and human–computer interaction experts.

**Speaker 2:**
So a real cross-disciplinary thing.

**Speaker 1:**
Exactly—exploring how they managed to make something imperceptible, perceptible.

**Speaker 2:**
You know, stepping back a bit, this project really tackles a core problem with how science is often communicated.

**Speaker 1:**
How so?

**Speaker 2:**
Well, it leans heavily on abstract concepts and visuals. That’s fine for some, but it can be a barrier for others.

**Speaker 1:**
Yeah, I can see that.

**Speaker 2:**
So the big idea here is that embodying abstract ideas with multiple senses can create deeper meaning, making science more engaging and accessible.

**Speaker 1:**
Making science genuinely more inclusive.

**Speaker 2:**
Precisely.

**Speaker 1:**
And that’s the challenge. Modern cosmology and astrophysics deal with scales and concepts so far removed from our daily lives.

**Speaker 2:**
Absolutely. It’s not just complicated maths, it’s stuff we literally can’t directly sense.

**Speaker 1:**
Like dark matter itself—five times more common than the matter that makes up us and everything we see.

**Speaker 2:**
Right. But it doesn’t interact with light, hardly interacts with anything except gravity.

**Speaker 1:**
So how do you get a feel for that? It definitely creates barriers for public engagement, even though people are fascinated by space.

**Speaker 2:**
So the critical question was: how do you even begin to bridge that gap?

**Speaker 1:**
Okay.

**Speaker 2:**
This project’s answer, or at least its hypothesis, was grounding abstract facts in bodily sensory experience.

**Speaker 1:**
Like bypassing the usual knowledge hurdles.

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly. Creating a participatory exchange between scientists and the public. Moving beyond just hearing facts to maybe feeling them.

**Speaker 1:**
That makes sense. Has this kind of thing been tried before?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes—this builds on earlier multisensory science communication, especially for accessibility.

**Speaker 1:**
Like what?

**Speaker 2:**
For example, the Tactile Universe project: 3D printed galaxy models for kids with visual impairments. The Tactile Collider used 3D soundscapes and tactile models for particle physics.

**Speaker 1:**
Okay, so using touch and sound.

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly. And then GI Astronomy—where people could literally taste the evolution of the universe.

**Speaker 1:**
Taste the Big Bang? Seriously?

**Speaker 2:**
Sort of. Experiencing the multiverse through flavours. People with sight loss called it life changing because it bypassed visuals entirely.

**Speaker 1:**
Wow. That’s powerful.

**Speaker 2:**
And beyond science—Tate Sensorium in the art world. It used all five senses, even midair haptics. It won awards. Visitors loved it.

**Speaker 1:**
So the appetite is clearly there. How did the Dark Matter project push things further?

**Speaker 2:**
Their aim was to weave all five senses into a stronger sense of embodiment. It wasn’t just “here’s some information,” but sparking engagement, curiosity, and positive feelings towards science.

**Speaker 1:**
And inclusivity?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes—especially for audiences who might be excluded otherwise, like neurodiverse young adults or people with visual impairments. But really it benefits everyone.

**Speaker 1:**
So why dark matter?

**Speaker 2:**
Because it’s exciting, invisible, and perfect for making the imperceptible perceptible.

**Speaker 1:**
Okay. So what was the actual setup?

**Speaker 2:**
Inside an inflatable planetarium dome at the London Science Museum. Black, enclosed, intimate. Only two participants at a time.

**Speaker 1:**
Very personal. And what was the journey like?

**Speaker 2:**
Quirky, even Matrix-inspired. You “took a pill” that transformed you into a dark matter detector. The three-minute experience combined sound, taste, touch, smell, and vision.

**Speaker 1:**
Tell me about the pill.

**Speaker 2:**
It was unflavoured popping candy inside a capsule. With noise-cancelling headphones, the crackling amplified into a skull-filling sensation.

**Speaker 1:**
Clever. And there was narration?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes—by Gareth Mitchell of the BBC. Jargon-free, authoritative yet playful. Timed perfectly with sensory inputs. Ending with: “May the dark matter be with you.”

**Speaker 1:**
Nice. And the other senses?

**Speaker 2:**
Soundscapes of dark matter “wind.” Midair ultrasonic haptics on your hand. Black pepper oil for smell. Some visuals, but often deliberately turned off to heighten the others.

**Speaker 1:**
Bold move. So how did people react?

**Speaker 2:**
Huge success. In 2018, people waited 45 minutes. Feedback scores high for immersion and enjoyment. But confidence in explaining dark matter after was only moderate.

**Speaker 1:**
So it excelled at engagement, less so at factual learning.

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly. Later runs confirmed curiosity about the multisensory novelty was as big a draw as the science itself. Wide age range, good gender balance, visitors with disabilities included.

**Speaker 1:**
So inclusivity was achieved.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes. And interestingly, when visuals were off, touch and sound dominated. When visuals were on, vision took over—even for understanding.

**Speaker 1:**
So sometimes removing vision can boost the value of other senses.

**Speaker 2:**
Precisely. And they found roles differed: taste for enjoyment, hearing and touch for understanding, smell for novelty.

**Speaker 1:**
Fascinating. Any practical lessons?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes—engage people in queues with quizzes. Explain the innovation itself, not just the science.

**Speaker 1:**
And the future?

**Speaker 2:**
Replication is tricky—too complex and costly. But the team hopes to open-source toolkits, using everyday tech, so schools and small museums can build their own multisensory experiences.

**Speaker 1:**
That would democratise science communication.

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
So the big takeaway?

**Speaker 2:**
That multisensory design can transform how we experience abstract science. It wasn’t just about learning facts—it was about embodying them.

**Speaker 1:**
And it leaves us wondering: what other invisible concepts could be made tangible this way? Not just in science, but in economics, philosophy, social issues.

**Speaker 2:**
It’s a provocative idea—making the abstract embodied. A whole new way to connect.
