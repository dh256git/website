summary: >
  Tune in to discover why current web accessibility guidelines often fall short for blind and partially sighted people trying to interact with data visualisations. We'll explore a new approach that introduces three key design dimensions: structure, navigation, and description, to create rich screen reader experiences. Learn how these designs help users conceptualise data spatially, selectively attend to data of interest, and gain control over their data analysis process.
