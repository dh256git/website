summary: >
  In this podcast episode, our AI hosts discuss how mid-air haptics can improve 2D shape recognition. They reveal that dynamic tactile pointers significantly enhance accuracy and confidence. Notably, introducing pauses at corners for polygons drastically improves recognition, with optimal durations of 300 ms for squares and 467 ms for triangles. They also explore applications in in-car interfaces and assistive technology.
