summary: >
  This podcast episode will discuss why customization is crucial for making data visualizations accessible to blind and partially sighted people, who have widely-varying needs. You'll learn about four key design goals for accessible visualizations: presence, verbosity, ordering, and duration; and how modeling content as reconfigurable tokens can achieve these goals. Discover how this approach, implemented in tools like Olli, increases the ease of identifying and remembering information for blind individuals, despite introducing some complexity.
