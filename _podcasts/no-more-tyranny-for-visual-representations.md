summary: >
  Tune in to learn about Umwelt, a groundbreaking authoring environment designed for blind and partially sighted individuals and their sighted collaborators to independently create and explore multimodal data representations. We'll discuss how it de-centers traditional visual-first approaches, treating visualization, sonification, and textual descriptions as co-equal ways to understand data, and how this enables complementary overview and detailed perspectives for analysis.
